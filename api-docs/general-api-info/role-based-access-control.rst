Role Based Access Control
=========================

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the capabilities of
Rackspace Cloud services, including the next gen Cloud Servers API, to
authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace Cloud customers to specify
which account users of their Cloud account have access to which next gen
Cloud Servers API service capabilities, based on roles defined by
Rackspace (see Next Gen Cloud Servers Product Roles and
Permissions). The permissions to perform certain operations in next gen
Cloud Servers API – create, read, update, delete – are assigned to specific
roles. The account owner user assigns these roles, either global (multiproduct)
or product-specific (for example, next gen Cloud Servers), to account
users.

Assigning roles to account users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The account owner (identity:user-admin) can create account users on the
account and then assign roles to those users. The roles grant the
account users specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the
next gen Cloud Servers service. Each account has only one account owner,
and that role is assigned by default to any Rackspace Cloud account when
the account is created.

See the *Cloud Identity Client Developer Guide* for information about how
to perform the following tasks:

-  :rax-devdocs:`Add user <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#add-user>`

-  :rax-devdocs:`Add role to user <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#add-role-to-user>`

-  :rax-devdocs:`Delete global role from user <cloud-identity/v2/developer-guide/#delete-global-role-from-user>`

.. note:: The account owner (identity:user-admin) role cannot hold any
   additional roles because it already has full access to all capabilities.

Roles available for Cloud Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three roles (observer, creator, and admin) can be used to access the Cloud
Databases API specifically. The following table describes these roles and their
permissions.

**Table: Cloud Databases product roles and capabilities**

+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Role Name      | Role Permissions                                                    |
+================+=====================================================================+
| dbaas:admin    | This role provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete permissions     |
|                | in Cloud Databases, where access is granted.                        |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| dbaas:creator  | This role provides Create, Read and Update permissions              |
|                | in Cloud Databases, where access is granted.                        |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| dbaas:observer | This role provides Read permission in Cloud Databases,              |
|                | where access is granted.                                            |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Additionally, two multiproduct roles apply to all products. Users with
multiproduct roles inherit access to future products when those products
become RBAC-enabled. The following table describes these roles and their
permissions.

**Table: Multiproduct (global) roles and permissions**

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Role Name | Role Permissions                                                         |
+===========+==========================================================================+
| admin     | This role provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete permissions          |
|           | in all products, where access is granted.                                |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| observer  | This role provides Read permission in all products, where                |
|           | access is granted.                                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Resolving conflicts between roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The account owner can set roles for both multiproduct and Cloud
Databases scope, and it is important to understand how any potential
conflicts among these roles are resolved. When two roles appear to
conflict, the role that provides the more extensive permissions takes
precedence. Therefore, admin roles take precedence over observer and
creator roles, because admin roles provide more permissions.

The following scenarios show examples of how potential conflicts
between user roles in the Control Panel are resolved:

**Scenario 1:**
Configuration : User is assigned the following roles: multiproduct **observer**
and Cloud Databases **admin**.

View: Appears that the user has only the multiproduct **observer** role.

Permissions: The user can perform product admin functions in the Control Panel
for Cloud Databases only. The user has the **observer** role for the
rest of the products.

**Scenario 2:**
Configuration: User is assigned the following roles: multiproduct **admin** and
Cloud Databases **observer**

View: Appears that the user has only the multiproduct **admin** role.

Permissions: The user can perform product admin functions in the Control Panel
for all of the products. The Cloud Databases **observer** role is ignored.

RBAC permissions cross-reference to Cloud Databases API operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API operations for Cloud Databases may or may not be available to
all roles. To see which operations are permitted to invoke which calls,
