General API information
=======================

Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the API
Operations chapter for details about specific operations.

The Rackspace Cloud Databases API is implemented using a ReSTful web service
interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the DB service
shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access
between products and services.

.. note::

   All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed
   using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
